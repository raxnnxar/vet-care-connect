# Backend API

This directory contains the mock backend APIs used by the application. In a real application, these would be replaced with actual API calls to a server.

The backend is organized as follows:

```
backend/
├── api/ - API functions for different resources
└── data/ - Mock data in JSON format
```

Note: The actual data files remain in the src/backend/data directory due to project constraints.
