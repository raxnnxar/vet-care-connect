# Navigation

This directory contains components and configuration for application navigation.

## Structure

- `AppNavigator.tsx` - Main navigation component
- `navigationConfig.ts` - Navigation constants and types
- Feature-specific navigators (AuthNavigator, OwnerNavigator, etc.)

## Usage Guidelines

- Keep navigation configuration centralized
- Define routes as constants to avoid typos
- Consider access control in navigation decisions
- Handle route parameters consistently
