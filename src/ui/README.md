# UI Components

This directory contains shared UI components that are used across multiple features. These components should be presentational and not contain business logic.

## Structure

- `atoms/` - Small, standalone UI elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- `molecules/` - Composite components made up of atoms
- `templates/` - Layout templates and structural components

## Usage Guidelines

- Keep UI components decoupled from business logic
- Focus on reusability and composability
- Document props with TypeScript interfaces
- Use Storybook or similar to showcase components
- Follow established design patterns and accessibility guidelines
